## VPIA

This platform uses Matterwiki as the underlying wiki engine. This will most likely be heavily customized. Currently using MySQL.

### Navigating the files
`api/` directory contains code for node backend. 
TODO: add Matterwiki's api documentation

`client/`directory contains the React jsx files and almost all the front end.

`models/` has the bookshelf database models that work with SQLite and MySQL. TODO: see if Postgres works too and if we can swap it for Mongoose and Mongo if need be.
